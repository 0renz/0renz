# Hi there!

I'm a developer Specializing in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning in the Cloud ☁️, with a special focus on **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning** within the **AWS** ecosystem.

My experience covers the full lifecycle of AI/ML projects, from conceptualization and **scalable system** architecture to **infrastructure automation** (IaC) and **model optimization** for performance and cost-efficiency.

Here are some of the technologies I frequently work with:
